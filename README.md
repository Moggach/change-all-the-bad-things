# Change all the bad things 🗳️

This project is a contact form for a fictional social justice group.

The user inputs from the contact form are displayed on a card below on submit.

Site header:

Contact form:

User details:

I wrote a series of functions to check and validate the form inputs.
The requirements for validation for phone number and email address could be more stringent.

If I had more time on this project I would like to add a database layer. I would also like to add authentification to view user inputs 🔑 Potentially I could also look at generating an automated email acknowledging reciept to the user and/or alerting site owner to a submission.
